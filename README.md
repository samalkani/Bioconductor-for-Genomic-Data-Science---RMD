## Bioconductor-for-Genomic-Data-Science---HTML

This repository covers an introduction to the Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/) including how to install and use Bioconductor software. It is a review of common data structures, including __ExpressionSets__, __SummarizedExperiment__ and __GRanges__ used across several types of analyses. Several popular packages for analysis and annotation of your data will be covered, including packages such as __GenomicRanges__, __biomaRt__, __rtracklayer__, __AnnotationHub__ and others.

The HTML files can be downloaded and view in a web-browser. There is aso a link to the corresponding file in __R__ and __HTML__ in separate repositories
