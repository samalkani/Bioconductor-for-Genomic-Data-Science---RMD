## Question 1

Use the Annotation Hub package to obtain data on “CpG Islands” in the 
human genome. How many islands exists on the autosomes?

### A. Installing the AnnotationHub package

```{r 1A. Installing the AnnotationHub package}
# BiocManager::install("AnnotationHub")

```

### B. Load AnnotationHub

```{r 1B. Load AnnotationHub}
library(AnnotationHub)

```

### C. Retrieve the cpg

```{r 1C. Retrieve the cpg}
ah <- AnnotationHub()
ah_human <- subset(ah, species == "Homo sapiens")
ah_human
ah_human_cpg <- query(ah_human, "CpG Islands")
ah_human_cpg
ah_human_cpg_record <- ah_human_cpg[["AH5086"]]
ah_human_cpg_record

```

### D. Extract autosomes

```{r 1D. Extract autosomes}
filter <- c(paste("chr", 1:22, sep=""))
filter
split_record <- split(ah_human_cpg_record, seqnames(ah_human_cpg_record))
split_record
autosomes <- split_record[filter]
autosomes

```

### E. Check the number of autosomes

```{r 1E. Check the number of autosomes}
unlist(autosomes)

```

## Question 2

How many CpG Islands exists on chromosome 4.

### A Print Autosomes

```{r 2A. A Print Autosomes}
autosomes[4]

```

### or B

```{r 2B. or B}
autosomes$chr4

```

## Question 3

Obtain the data for the H3K4me3 histone modification for the H1 cell line
from Epigenomics roadmap, using AnnotationHub. Subset these regions to 
only keep regions mapped to the autosomes (chromosomes 1 to 22). How many
bases does these regions cover?

### A. Retrieve the record

```{r 3A. Retrieve the record}
ah_H3K4me3 <- query(ah, c("H3K4me3", "narrowpeak", "E003"))
ah_H3K4me3

```

### B. Select the narrowpeak

```{r 3B. Select the narrowpeak}
ah_H3K4me3_record <- ah_H3K4me3[["AH29884"]]
ah_H3K4me3_record

```

### C. Extract autosomes and check the number of regions cover

```{r 3C. Extract autosomes and check the number of regions cover}
split_H3K4me3 <- split(ah_H3K4me3_record, seqnames(ah_H3K4me3_record))
split_H3K4me3
H3K4me3_autosomes <- split_H3K4me3[filter]
H3K4me3_autosomes
sum(width(unlist(H3K4me3_autosomes)))

```

## Question 4

Obtain the data for the H3K27me3 histone modification for the H1 cell line
from Epigenomics Roadmap, using the Annotation Hub package. Subset these 
regions to only keep regions mapped to the autosomes. In the return data, 
each region has an associated "signalValue".

Question: What is the mean signalValue across all regions on the standard
chromosomes?

### A. Retrieve the record

```{r 4A. Retrieve the record}
ah_H3K27me3 <- query(ah, c("H3K27me3", "narrowpeak", "E003"))
ah_H3K27me3
ah_H3K27me3_record <- ah_H3K27me3[["AH29892"]]
ah_H3K27me3_record

```

### B. Extract autosomes

```{r 4B. Extract autosomes}
split_H3K27me3 <- split(ah_H3K27me3_record, seqnames(ah_H3K27me3_record))
split_H3K27me3
H3K27me3_autosomes <- split_H3K27me3[filter]
H3K27me3_autosomes

```

### C. Create a subset of extracted autosomes

```{r 4C. Create a subset of extracted autosomes}
ah_H3K27me3_autosomes <- subset(ah_H3K27me3_record, seqnames %in% filter)
ah_H3K27me3_autosomes

```

### D. Mean signalValue

```{r 4D. Mean signalValue}
mean_signalValue <- mean(ah_H3K27me3_autosomes$signalValue)
mean_signalValue

```

## Question 5

Bivalent regions are bound by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. Using the regions
we have obtained above, how many bases on the standard chromosomes are 
bivalently marked?

### A. Intersect between two records

```{r 5A. Intersect between two records}
bivalent <- intersect(unlist(H3K4me3_autosomes), unlist(H3K27me3_autosomes))
bivalent
sum(width(bivalent))

```

## Question 6

We will examine the extent to which bivalent regions overlap CpG Islands, 
how big a fraction (expressed as a number between 0 and 1) of the bivalent
regions, overlap one or more CpG Islands

### A. Find bivalent regions overlap CpG Islands

```{r 6A. Find bivalent regions overlap CpG Islands}
cpg_autosomes <- autosomes
cpg_autosomes
cpg_bivalent <- findOverlaps(bivalent, unlist(cpg_autosomes))
cpg_bivalent

```

### B. Calculate the fraction of the bivalent regions overlap CpG Islands

```{r 6B. Calculate the fraction of the bivalent regions overlap CpG Islands}
fraction_bivalent <- length(unique(queryHits(cpg_bivalent)))/length(bivalent)
fraction_bivalent

```

## Question 7

How big a fraction (expressed as a number between 0 and 1) of the bases 
which are part of CpG Islands, are also bivalent marked?

### A. Intersect between bivalent regions and CpG Islands

```{r 7A. Intersect between bivalent regions and CpG Islands}
cpg_bivalent_intersect <- intersect(bivalent, unlist(cpg_autosomes))
cpg_bivalent_intersect

```

### B. Calculate the fraction of the bases intersected between CpG Islands and bivalent 

```{r 7B. Calculate the fraction of the bases intersected between CpG Islands and bivalent}
fraction_bivalent_intersect <- 
        sum(width(reduce(cpg_bivalent_intersect)))/sum(width(unlist(cpg_autosomes)))
fraction_bivalent_intersect

```

## Question 8

How many bases are bivalently marked within 10kb of CpG Islands? Tip: 
consider using the "resize()"" function.

### A. Extract CpG Islands within 10kb

```{r 8A. Extract CpG Islands within 10kb}
cpg_10kb <- 
        resize(unlist(cpg_autosomes), width = 20000 + width(unlist(cpg_autosomes)), 
               fix = "center")
cpg_10kb
cpg_10kb_bivalent <- intersect(cpg_10kb, bivalent)
cpg_10kb_bivalent
sum(width(cpg_10kb_bivalent))

```

## Question 9

How big a fraction (expressed as a number between 0 and 1) of the human 
genome is contained in a CpG Island? Tip 1: the object returned by 
AnnotationHub contains "seqlengths". Tip 2: you may encounter an integer 
overflow. As described in the session on R Basic Types, you can address 
this by converting integers to numeric before summing them, "as.numeric()".

### A. Calculate human genome size

```{r 9A. Calculate human genome size}
chr_list <- c(paste("chr", 1:22, sep=""))
chr_list
genome <- keepSeqlevels(ah_human_cpg_record, chr_list, pruning.mode = "coarse")
genome
genome_size <- sum(as.numeric(seqlengths(genome)))
genome_size

```

### B. Calculate the fraction of human genome which contained a CpG Island

```{r 9B. Calculate the fraction of human genome which contained a CpG Island}
cpg_autosomes_size <- sum(as.numeric(width(unlist(cpg_autosomes))))
cpg_autosomes_size / genome_size

```

## Question 10

Compute an odds-ratio for the overlap of bivalent marks with CpG islands.

### A. Calculate InOut matrix

```{r 10A. Calculate InOut matrix}
overlapMat <- matrix(0,, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
overlapMat
colnames(overlapMat) <- c("in", "out")
rownames(overlapMat) <- c("in", "out")
overlapMat[1,1] <- sum(width(cpg_bivalent_intersect))
overlapMat[1,1]
overlapMat[1,2] <- sum(width(setdiff(bivalent, unlist(cpg_autosomes))))
overlapMat[1,2]
overlapMat[2,1] <- sum(width(setdiff(unlist(cpg_autosomes), bivalent)))
overlapMat[2,1]
overlapMat[2,2] <- genome_size - sum(overlapMat)
overlapMat[2,2]
overlapMat

```

### B. Calculate odds-ratio

```{r 10B. Calculate odds-ratio}
oddsRatio <- overlapMat[1,1] * overlapMat[2,2] / (overlapMat[2,1] * overlapMat[1,2])
oddsRatio

```
